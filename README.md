# texteditor_8086

This project presents a basic text editor developed using assembly language tailored for the x86 architecture. It offers a hands-on approach to understanding low-level programming, BIOS interrupts, and the intricate relationship between software and hardware.

Features:
1. Developed in assembly language for the x86 architecture.
2. Utilizes BIOS interrupts for essential functions.
3. Supports character insertion, backspacing, and handling of the ESCAPE key.
4. Offers insights into cursor management, memory handling, and input/output operations.

Technologies Used
1. Assembly language for the x86 architecture
2. BIOS interrupts
